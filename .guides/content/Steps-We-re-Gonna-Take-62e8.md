Here are the steps we'll go through to do this:

**1) Create fragments for the major hubs.**

**2) Create and initialize the navigation drawer.**
The navigation drawer will contain a `ListView` displaying the list of options.

**3) Get the ListView to respond to item clicks.**
This will allow the user to navigate to the major hubs of the app.

**4) Add an ActionBarDrawerToggle.**
This lets the user control the drawer through the action bar and allows the activity to respond to drawer open and close events.
