We’re going to change `MainActivity` so that it uses a drawer layout. It will contain a frame layout for displaying fragments, and a list view to display a list of options.

The list view will contain options for Home, Pizzas, Pasta, and Stores so that the user can easily navigate to the major hubs of the app. We’ll create fragments for these different options. This means that we’ll be able to switch the fragments at runtime, and the user will be able to access the navigation drawer from each of the different screens.
